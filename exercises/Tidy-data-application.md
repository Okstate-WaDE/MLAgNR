Tidy data principles and other data management concepts are a great way to think about organizing data, but they really only help us if we actually put them into practice. For this exercise you may choose one of two options:

1. The first option is to create a spreadsheet for managing your own research data.  For this option you will need to create a spreadsheet or set of spreadsheets based on principles from the readings for this lesson. You will also need to create data validation rules for each column to ensure data are entered correctly.

OR

2. The second option is to write a 500-word detailed description of how you will implement data validation and tidy data principles within your thesis project.

In either case, the goal of this exercise is for you to carefully think through how to capture and organize your data so that you will be able to trust in the accuracy of your data and easily manipulate them for further analysis.
