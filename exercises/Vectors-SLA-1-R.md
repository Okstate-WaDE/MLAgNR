You have data on the leaf mass and area for wheat samples stored in the
following vectors:

```
leaf_mass <- c(1.62, 2.34, 1.84, 1.78, 3.89, 2.57, 1.74, 1.53, 3.42, 2.58)
leaf_area <- c(428, 547, 499, 253, 513, 325, 296, 468, 575, 468)
```

Copy these vectors into an R script and then determine the following:

1. The specific leaf area (SLA) of each leaf (i.e. the area divided by mass)
2. The total leaf mass of all samples
3. A vector of the SLA of samples with leaf mass less than 3
